Hi, welcome to my homepage.

I am a third year PhD candidate in Reinforcement Learning at Université Paris-Saclay, working on Learning-based Control of Dynamical Systems with applications in Computational Fluid Dynamics.
My research is supervised by [Anne Vilnat](https://perso.limsi.fr/anne/), [Onofrio Semeraro](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=kregZ48AAAAJ&hl=en), and [Lionel Mathelin](https://perso.limsi.fr/mathelin/).

Before my PhD, I completed a [MSc in Artificial Intelligence, Systems, and Data (IASD)](https://www.masteriasd.eu/fr/), a [MSc in Statistics and Financial Mathematics](https://dauphine.psl.eu/formations/masters/mathematiques-et-applications/m2-ingenierie-statistique-et-financiere) and a BSc in Applied Mathematics (probability and statistics)  at Université Paris Dauphine - PSL.

I have research experience at Inria TAU and IFP Énergies Nouvelles, where I worked on learning-based methods for stiff differential equations, Koopman operator theory, and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).
I also gained industry experience as a Data Scientist at BNP Paribas Real Estate, a Quantitative Research Intern at Capital Fund Management (CFM), and a Deep Learning Research Intern at Luxurynsight.
