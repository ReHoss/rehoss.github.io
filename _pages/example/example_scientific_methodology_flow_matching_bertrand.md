### Scientific Methodology of Flow Matching Generalization

* **Observation:** Modern generative models, like diffusion and flow matching, generalize remarkably well, but the reasons are unclear.
* **Question/Problem:** Is the *stochastic (noisy) nature* of the flow matching loss a primary reason for this strong generalization?
* **Hypothesis:** The stochastic nature of the loss is *not* a primary contributor to generalization, and a non-stochastic (closed-form) loss will perform comparably.
* **Method (to test the Hyp.):** Empirically compare the training losses and final statistical performance of models trained with the stochastic loss versus the closed-form loss.
* **Experiment:** Train state-of-the-art flow matching models on standard image datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10) using both loss variants.
* **Analysis:** Both loss variants yielded nearly equivalent loss values and achieved comparable (or even better) statistical performance.
* **Conclusion:** We ruled out the stochastic nature of the loss as a primary contributor to the effective generalization of flow matching models.
